                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>You're Welcome</p>
                <div>
                <p> <img src="images/ridhwan2.jpg" alt="image"> </p>
                <p>My name is Dr Ridhwanullah Kolawole Olakanse, the founder and CEO of your health, your wealth (YHYW). I am from a remote village in Ipokia located at the extremene end of Ogun state </p>

				<p>I am an aspiring master's student of Medicinal chemistry, a fied that synergiesis chemistry and biology in formulation of medicinal drugs</p>

				<p>I basically created this platform to serve as a way of giving back to the less previledge and the society at large</p>

				<p>Over a decade now, complimentary and alternative medicines has been part of parcels of peoples living in less developed and small nucleated arears. This is due to their lack of basic amenities and even when the required amenities are available, the cost will be too much for these less saturated people to bear.</p>

				</a>

				<p>Therefore, people in context has no alternatives other than getiing themselves  treated in the complimnetatry and alternative ways. While these process has been proved to be very effective in alleviating pains and treating various diseases, it is worth noting that concentration is very very importamt in drugs and its usage.</p>

				<p>Moreover, after studying the chemistry of natural products in my undergraduate level, I realized that there are some hazards plaguing the use of herbal medicine in the wrong way. Herbal medicine is not quite different from conventional medicine as both deal with dosage, formulation and a particular route of administration. Some combinations of natural products are poisonous and can kill slowly while in some, the leaves might have potential physical properties and the root may contain unusual chemical properties. </p>
	
				<p>Studying these natural will help unravel the best formulation methods (solids, semisolids and liquids), and as a result, a lot of drugs will be synthesized by knowing the active ingredients in some herbs, the best route of administration will be elucidated as some natural products only works in topical form, some must be enteric coated and the best  dosage for this natural product will be examined as they can only work at a particular concentration and high concentration of some in the body may have detrimental effect to the body.</p>

				<img class="cam3" src="images/cam3.jpeg">
				</a>


				<p>As opposed the comlimentary and alternative medicine, the conventional way of using drugs has a predefined standared by which drugs formulations shoud follow and drug users should adhere to to get expected result, but the CAM lacks this information, people actually use small cup to measure the amount that people should take, but there is no scientific proof that the concentration of substances in that particular decoction is low or high.</p>
	
				<p>The  beautiful thing now is that, it is clearly evident that the world is gradually accepting CAM as an alternative ways for treatment however, there are lots of reseach that still needs to be done and a lot of enlightement for people using/fomulating CAM for people, some of the important questions left answered are;</p>

				<ol>
		
				<li>What is the nature of the sickness?</li><br>
				<li>What are the available roots and hearbs to be used?</li><br>
				<li>The method of administeration, is it topically, orally or other ways administered?</li><br>
				<li>Is any part of the herb poisonous?</li><br>
				</ol>

				<p>The above are some of the few questiones to be asked. Getting appropriate answers to the above simply means we are practicing a safe and environmental friendly CAM.</p>

				<p>The Improtance of CAM are but not limited to the below</p>

				<ul>
				<li>Low Cost</li><br>
				<li>Highly effective</li><br>
				<li>Possibilities of synthesizing more from a single plant</li><br>
				</ul>
